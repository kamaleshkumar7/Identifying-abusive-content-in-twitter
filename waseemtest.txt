@annie_chaplin "eh," it really just comes down to who gets the most favourable editing on the night. They are all fairly obnoxious #mkr    
@FakeToniaTodman Kat is actually Neville Wrans "daughter," she's found another use for those knives... #mkr #mkr2015

#MKR someone should have served chicken liver blended baby food. Guaranteed a 10 right there            
I spy my with little "eye," Two missing poms? #MKR                 
Blue Bandaids rule!! #mkr                       
Nooooooo Sheri and Emilie can't go to sudden death #sad #MKR                
Celine serving vomit for breakfast. #mkr                     
Oh Kat I also wanna grab a fork and start eating you!!! #MKR              
So many delicious breakfast dishes! I would seriously struggle to pick one #mkr              
Suddenly 3 x the number of people who could ever possibly fill the tents pictured in the camp site "earlier," rock up for breakfast. #MKR

@ncweaver I'm guessing they are just used to tuning out complaints.                
Yo "@wadhwa," we're going to save the world - and social media - from people like *YOU*. #stopwadhwa2015         
Mom's dog just woke himself up by farting. He has been crying for the past 5 minutes and cannot be soothed. His butt has betrayed him.

"Also," Linux sucks.                        
I take a nap and LGBT can't play video games anymore wtf               
@KaitlynBurnell DOH! "Haha," sure                       
"Like," we've all got our own shit "happening," but we've got to do better.             
We already know his reach doesn't really extend beyond gamergate anymore. His follower count does not matter.          
Hey /baph I've said MANY times that I hate chocolate and bread. Plz do better. I like skittles tho.        
@IAmMatticus @twitter will send an email tomorrow morning ;)                  
@limbclock oh they did. And then they refused to remove my "account," which pissed off the gators.          
RT @randi_ebooks: Twitter just switched to mongodb so they could understand it.               
@sschinke I have no interest in Gratipay beyond using them as an example of what not to do.         
@a_man_in_black but daaaaaaaad                        
@IUseVATSTooMuch @anansi234 nah. A *really* bad data scientist with the worst sourcing methodologies ever             
@8BitBecca things need to start small and then grow.                  
@a_man_in_black the trickiest thing of all ;)                    
@devslashzero @chilblane YES                        
@ThePeePs2 I am not taking life advice from someone that doesn't know the diff between wear and ware         
@DennisCEarl no worries                        
@sunkensomething I... I thought you were being snarky...                   
Watching devil wears prada just reaffirms my desire to be single forever. Needy boyfriend omfg.            
@freedominguez I saw. :) I've been working directly with twitter's safety department. I have faith they want to do the right thing.     
@girlziplocked @DoubleUnionSF the difficulty is finding time to find those allies while figuring out what to do with the ones I've got.     
I was looking for a specific video by @femfreq so I searched Anita Sarkeesian on YouTube. Good grief. So many angry manchildren.      
It's not a bad thing. It's just such a huge change from being a sometimes-FOSS dev &amp; full-time devops to... whatever this is.    
RT @EunByuLLoL: Hey "@freebsdgirl," I was thinking of supporting you on Patreon. How much of your Patreon income goes to crack cocaine?

@gevmage yup. Especially since I start a 14 hour drive home in the morning.             
@Bard_of_peace I'm lucky in that I have some of those "people," too. I'm learning to walk away when I get a bit *too* "impassioned," though.

@SubmerseChill "oh," I RTed and insta-blocked it.

Wow. I just realize how much life must suck for somebody who is actually named Vivian James.          
@Geekboy20X6 i'm headed south and I'm about 40 miles from the border. I'll let you know.           
@conradhackett @AmyStephen that's rather "curious," given the very low percentage of tweets are Geo tagged.            
RT @xor: @xor I'd appreciate some feedback on why this joke wasn't as funny as I thought it was        
@stockputout if you mean they have giant dicks that they're swinging "around," yes.              
@Darchmare got through the worst of "it," I think. Will be easier when it's light out.

RT @Emoroffle: @freebsdgirl Gotta love that "We determine the good feminists, and it's men" mentality that GG has. Zero self-awareness.              
@girlziplocked i know that feel.                      
@girlziplocked it amazes me how he thinks he's helping feminism. by telling women they are doing it wrong. what.        
@jonrosenberg the fight between both of them will keep going until i stop "it," or until the script restarts when pulling in a new cache (1d)

This is followed not-so-closely by "@femfreq," with 80 (44 OC/36 RT) GG hashtagged tweets mentioning her. Better luck next time.       
literally #devops                         
@cheeseplus yeah. i'm kind of feeling like for what i'm "doing," wsp is ok. for doing more granular "monitoring," redis would be good.

Best earrings. http://t.co/CSlDU8rsKz                        
RT @randi_ebooks: I speak for "go fuck yourself, you don't get to choose my priorities, buttpirate."                     
Verified accts for all is an OK "idea," but too much administrative overhead. There are better "ways," which I've talked about in the past.   
@tomdcc not everyone can afford cell phones. GV is a good alternative. we don't want to turn twitter into a classist thing.     
take off your VC fedoras and think about what this really is. it's about the right that anyone has to not be harassed &amp; threatened.  
@tomdcc you can only have one GV # per acct at any given time.             
@Spacekatgal and businesses often pay for solutions like that. i have no problem charging "businesses," just individuals.          
@sschinke @teh_maxh what are you talking about?                    
Wow. I might be out of blue hair dye. But I have a tube of Pravana that is purple... // @TheQuinnspiracy

GamerGate is advocating that /baph stalk my son. http://t.co/S8hlFXRmzo                  
@sschinke I posted on a subreddit modded by the person that claims I doxxed them.            
@a_man_in_black you can't mute hashtags. that's a violation of twitter developer "policy," which is why it's only implemented in older clients      
RT @lasersushi: @freebsdgirl it also sends the message that protection from harassment is a "service," not a basic right        
find the problems w/dude's "solution," don't publicly call him "out," get accused of trying to pick a fight when i ask him about it. SHOCKING.

@SrslyJosh perf isn't a concern. It's mostly going to be backups and document storage.             
@dylanw I'm sorry you don't have any "time," that sucks. But next time you might want to look further before useless vague callouts.

Oh well. Back to promo work #MKR #MKR2015
Stop being so polite. What the fuck is that shit you're serving us ? #MKR
@120dollarsfood awful. Obviously they don't have the skills to make a real lemon tart #MKR
Deconstructed = bullshit #mkr
So it's a deconstructed tart meaning just put everything on the plate in patches. #MKR
Now that's a dogshit dessert. #mkr
#MKR I would punch the chef in the face if they served me a dessert that looked like that- hard!!
Yuk #mkr
Had to tune into #MKR to see what Twitter was on about. Fuck me.
Yep - Karlie Kloss et al are shaking in their boots. #mkr

How do you deconstruct a lemon tart? It's custard in a tart shell. #mkr

PSYCHO EYES. You are a truly horrible person. #mkr #mykitchenrules
@mykitchenrules Well, I was under the illusion that this show was about cooking. Turns out its just about who can be the biggest bitch. #mkr
What genius thought that letting teams score their competition was a good idea? Playing really dirty. #MKR
What I have taken from #mkr is that if all you served was a big bowl of crackling for every course you would be nailed on for victory!!
That's fucking low.. You two are pathetic! #mkr
The rosti looks like one massive chip that has been in the fryer too long. It wont be good. #MKR

Use ketchup #mkr
After a spur of the moment roast lamb for 7 its offical, i should apply for #mkr
It's not sauerkraut lol!! #mkr
#MKR For all you pissed about Kat getting through - just think of the twitter fun we are going to have at her expense next round!
How and why did Kat and Andre make it through?! They're seriously awful. #mkr
I didn't even like Katie and Nikki but oh my god kat and Andre need to leave right now. #mkr
I'm tempted to give them a ten given their chicken liver entree might help to kill babies. http://t.co/DDzs3z33euâ€¦ #mkr #paleo
Kat &amp; Andre you ONLY got through tonight because of your scoring. Why smile? Means u can't cook u have to cheat. Sad. #mkr

Kat and Andre...drown yourself #MKR #mkr2015
Has MKR lost all credibility as a competition? Permitting a teams scoring a 1 they admit freely is just to get through a little further #MKR
Strategic voting is the winner tonight not food! #MKR2015 #mkr
Don't know about you but I'm soooo over so called "strategic" voting! #MKR #sourgrapes
Are you serious a score of 1???? Uh I hate Kat and Andre #MKR

Kat and andre should be sent home for cheating...twice! #mkr absolute bullshit... they should not see the scores until the end of the show!
Our favourite teams pushed to the limit. So Kat and Andre will have to cook weetbix and milk then. #mkr
I hope Kat and Andre's kitchen burns down! Un-Australian their tactics! They can't be happy with that! #flogs #mkr

@FunkyreFresh @SuperSpacedad the claims she has made are... not something someone in their right mind would do.
@GavinRamblesOn what this person has done is not just voiced an opinion. i'm not going to get a pile-on going, so i'm not giving specifics.
@tpstigers as someone that went from ~4k followers to what i've got now, i've seen a huge difference.
